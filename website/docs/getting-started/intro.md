# Introduction to Social Toolkit

Social Toolkit is a powerful service designed to enable applications with sophisticated brand understanding capabilities. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing your brand content and generating brand-aligned content across various media types.

## Key Features

• Multi-modal content analysis (text, images, video, audio)  
• Deep understanding of brand voice, style patterns, and messaging consistency  
• Automated, queue-based processing for high volumes of content  
• Custom prompts for analyzing specific brand aspects  
• Brand-aligned content generation with customizable parameters  

## End-to-End Flow

Below is a high-level overview of how Brand Memory works from start to finish:

1. **Tenant Creation**  
   Create a tenant, which represents your organization or application. Each tenant contains the brands and configurations you will use. Tenants can be organized hierarchically using parent-child relationships, allowing you to create structured organization of your brands and content.

2. **Brand Creation**  
   Set up a brand identity to unify all brand-specific content, guidelines, and knowledge.

3. **Analysis Configuration**  
   Design prompts to analyze brand materials for voice, style, compliance, and other aspects.

4. **Generation Setup**  
   Create specialized instructions (called "workers") that define how to generate content aligned with your brand. You can then run generation requests to produce brand-consistent outputs.

5. **Brand Compass**  
   A Brand Compass is a unified report that provides a holistic view of your brand by analyzing all brand-related content. It synthesizes information from your uploaded samples, knowledge, and guidelines to create a comprehensive brand understanding. The Brand Compass:
   - Powers content generation by providing style and tone guidance
   - Creates a complete picture of your brand's voice, messaging, and visual elements
   - Serves as the foundation for producing brand-aligned content
